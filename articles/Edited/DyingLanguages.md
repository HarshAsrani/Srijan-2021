It is generally and very truly said that nothing lasts forever, and programming languages are no exception. No matter how 'cool' or 'hyped' a programming language is, eventually the better ones take over, and the current 'favourite' fades away. Since the beginning of the computational revolution, there have been hundreds of programming languages, of which some have stood the test of time and are still widely used, while others haven't fare that well. They came, ruled and faded away. Among all the various possible reasons for this inevitable decline, one can be attributed to the fact that with time, new generations of developers embrace the languages and frameworks they find easier to work with.
Discussed below are few programming languages that are already obsolete, or are likely to be in the coming few years.

## Objective-C

Developed by Brad Cox in 1983, Objective-C is a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. The language follows the Smalltalk-derived syntax, and is notable for being the primary language used by Apple for both iOS and macOS. Objective-C continued to be the only language used for developing Apple software until 2014, when Swift arrived. Since then, the preference of Swift over Objective-C by the developers due to its various remarkable features like robustness and better memory management, has led Objective-C to find a place in the list of dying programming languages. Having said that, it has been 36 years since Objective-C came around, and the language still has some occupancy in the market. Hence, it will probably take a few more years for Swift to completely take over.

## Perl

Perl is a high-level programming language used for a wide range of tasks such as web development, text manipulation, GUI development, network programming, and many more. Originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987, Perl has numerous features that ease the task of a programmer, but it comes at the expense of significant CPU and memory requirements. These factors have resulted in its increasing disuse. The latest sister version of Perl - Perl 6, also known as Raku, was released in December 2015. This release did revive the language somewhat, but by then the advent of several other prominent programming languages, especially Python, had made it difficult for Perl to regain control over the market.

## Pascal

Pascal is a general-purpose procedural programming language that was specifically developed for teaching programming practices in a structured manner. Created by Niklaus Wirth, Pascal is a descendent of ALGOL 60.  It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, who invented the first mechanical calculator. It led to the development of Delphi (Object Pascal), which in general can be considered as an object-oriented derivation of Pascal. Because of its various features like easy-to-learn syntax, extensive error checking and a strongly typed system, Pascal used to be a fairly popular and in-demand language. But Delphi soon took its place, condemning it to the list of dead programming languages. However, considering its growth and demand in the current scenario, Delphi itself is on the verge of vanishing now.

## Haskell

Haskell is a general-purpose language supporting features like statical typing, functional programming, type inference and lazy evaluation. Designed for handling symbolic computations and list processing applications, it has held more relevance in the research and industrial application domain. It also supports various features such as better reliability, shorter lead times etc, which has earned it preference in several big-tech companies like Facebook, GitHub and IBM in the past. However, the TIOBE popularity index shows a consistent decline in its demand and usage in the past 8-10 years. This decline could be attributed to various factors like difficulty to learn, static typing and so on. These factors have made its demise imminent.

## VB.NET

Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), as the name suggests, is implemented on the .NET Framework. Visual Basic was developed by Microsoft as a variant of BASIC, and VB.NET was launched in 2002 as the successor to Visual Basic. It is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language. It has enjoyed its fair share of popularity for a long time, but the latest TIOBE Index reports show that VB.NET is now losing out to competitors like C#, which is taking over in terms of demand and popularity. Yet, due to its strong hold over the programming world in the past, VB.NET still has adequate occupancy in the market and will probably take years to die out.

In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with programming languages, that makes them disappear. It's just that with evolving technology, developers find alternatives to catch up with trends. The truth is that programming languages seldom really die, they just become outdated. A developer's responsibility is to to analyze trends, to understand the demands of the tech market and know the current and future scope of languages in the IT world, and adapt accordingly.
