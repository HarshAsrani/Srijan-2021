Among the various sectors that have benefited from the adoption of technology amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, education has been an active front runner. This situation has
transformed computer-based education from an optional tool, to a mandatory tool of continuous learning.

## What is CAE?

Computer-Aided Education (CAE) refers to the use of the computer as a tool to facilitate and improve education. It enables students to learn from a combination of technology
and the printed curriculum. This is to ensure a more interactive learning experience, contributing to the overall success of the learning strategy

## Types of Software used

- **Drill and practice software** is generally used the same way that worksheets or flashcards are used in classrooms, to provide feedback to the students. Flashcard Deluxe
 app is the best known example of this type of software, and provides the user with review opportunities and feedback as they answer questions.
 - **Tutorial software** is an instructional sequence on a topic, similar to the teacherâ€™s instructions in the classroom. They are meant to be used as a self-contained,
 supplemental, instructional resource.
 - **Problem-solving software** focuses on developing analytical, observational and logical skills. Some examples include MindManager, Layered process audit software, etc.
 - A **simulation** is a representation or model of a real event, object or phenomenon, where learners can see the results of their actions. This is a very powerful application
 of computers and the educational community can capitalize on this type of software. Examples of this kind are AnyLogic and MATLAB.
 - **Games** are the best way to learn and grasp concepts. Many games are knowledge-specific as well as fun. Scratch can be considered as a great example of this type of
 software, which provides colorful blocks and cartoon characters to teach coding to kids. Grammar Gorillas, Geoguesser are some other examples.
 
 ## Advantages of CAE
 
 - **Self-paced learning** : CAE is individualized and students can learn at their own pace, which eliminates peer pressure and accommodates both fast and slow learners.
 - **Self Evaluation**: CAE  provides a reporting system through which students can analyze their progress. Many tutorials come with progress bars and deadlines, that
  provide evaluations of learning from time to time and help students avoid procrastination.
  - **Structured Content**: Content on the Internet is scattered, and finding the right thing wastes a lot of time. CAE provides information in a structured manner, increasing
   learning efficiency.
  - **Visualizations**: Difficult concepts are made easy with the help of visuals, improving retention of knowledge and reducing teaching time.
  
  ## Drawbacks of CAE
  
  The most important objective of CAE is that the students should learn and understand what is being taught; this can often be hindered by other, exciting features that
  computers can provide. Avoiding distractions is a challenge, and the teacher should impose limits on student and computer interaction. Further, financial problems may
  refrain some students from owning a computer, placing them at a disadvantage. Content and tutorials getting outdated, as well as technical difficulties like network issues,
  are also obstacles to CAE. Additionally, though some software like simulation permits the execution of chemical and biological experiments, hands-on experience is missing
  in these cases.
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  Computer-aided education has the potential to transform the educational process, and greatly improve the efficiency of learning. But even with all the great features
  CAE has to offer, caution must be exercised to prevent overuse of multimedia in instruction. A balance must be worked out to harness CAE's full potential.
