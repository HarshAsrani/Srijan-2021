The judiciary is one of the institutions upon which rests the responsibility to maintain the noble edifice of democracy and the rule of law. The judiciary stands as a bulwark against the abuse, misuse or unfair accumulation of power by the executive, and protects citizens against governmental lawlessness. It is one of the three basic pillars of the Indian democracy. The stakeholders in courts are the judges, the litigants, the lawyers, the court staff, the general public and the government.

People often have a stereotyped outlook about Indian courts being slow, rigid and secretive. With the help of IT, this perception can be changed and courts can become more efficient, fast and responsible. IT is available for various uses in the Indian judiciary and its allied areas, and is already in operation in some courts.

## Areas where IT is already in use

- **Video-Conferencing**: The court is connected to the jail by ISDN Lines. At both ends, a camera unit and a display unit, like a 29" TV Screen, is provided, with recording facility at the court's end. Under-trial is produced at the jail end. The judge, jawyers and witnesses etc. remain present in the court. The judicial remand of the under-trial can also be extended without him being physically present in court. This ensures that dreaded criminals can be tried without any risk, savings can be achieved in the cost of the production of undertrials for remand extension, and multiple trials of an accused lodged in one jail is possible in different states of India.

- **Data Management**: Data can be captured at the filing stage for the new cases. Data of previous cases are fed in computers using dedicated manpower. This includes the date of filing, a full description of parties, the law provision invoked, property number, the stage of the trial, next date of hearing, advocate's name etc. Data is updated on a daily basis without fail.Thus, the press of a single button can generate cause-lists. Periodical statements can be easily generated and age-wise / category-wise segregation of cases is possible.

- **Digital Signatures**: The data which is to be sent through the internet is encrypted using the digital signature card, which the Service Provider provides. Said data is then sent to the receiver in an encrypted format. The data is then decrypted by the receiver, who uses the verifier software provided by the Service Provider. This means that release warrants can be sent from courts to jails within minutes of passing of the order. Also, certified copies can be issued instantly by the copying branch, as soon as the order is digitally signed.

- **Biometric Identification**: Biometric readers are readily available, and can be installed with the court computers. Biometric profiles of the accused, sureties, witnesses and other court users are prepared and kept in an online data bank. The biometric reader can identify such a person and their entire history can be retrieved. Therefore, an accused who gives a different name at the time of arrest can be easily identified. Stock witnesses who are in the habit of giving evidence in many cases can also be pinpointed.

- **E-Courts**: Paper-less courts with audio-visual presentation and video-conferencing facility allow automatic recording of evidence. They are modelled on the pattern of Court-21 of the USA. For existing files, scanning and OCR software can be used, so immediate retrieval is possible. Visual animations & presentation of arguments is also possible. E-courts have proved to be very effective during the coronavirus lockdown; many pending cases have been heard through this. E-filing is the first step towards E-court. Recently, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said, “The idea is to show the flexibility of the Indian judicial system. Not for a moment do we want to replace the physical hearing. But we are conscious of the need to protect the public health of our lawyers, litigants who come to our country or across the country.” The Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, has said that the Supreme Court has put forward a proposal to introduce a system of artificial intelligence that would facilitate in better administration of justice delivery. 

**Other ways** in which technology can impact the judiciary include AI, which is capable of assisting judges by predicting vital information regarding an ongoing case, based on past cases of a similar nature. Furthermore, as India is a multi-lingual country, speech recognition will help in improving the productivity of the judiciary and corporate legal departments, by supporting tasks such as streamlining documentation efforts. Additonally, blockchain can produce a time-stamped series of records of data, that is immutable and managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Managing court judgments, warrants and criminal histories are three record-keeping challenges that blockchain will help in addressing.

## Conclusion

As long as people do not receive justice timely, there is no significance of “JUSTICE, social, economic and political” mentioned in the preamble. For this, courts must be able to adapt more quickly to changes in laws, demographics and society, by taking advantage of the provisions that technology provides.
