We humans and all other organisms are nothing but a body of information that keeps updating through the process of natural selection to ensure our survival. Natural selection aims not to make an offspring disease free but to choose the best options from the parent's gene . Evidently, the offspring gets no choice but the slavery to his or her parental genome. It's like being told to play a game without consent and that too with default penalties. What if you could step in ?

While admonishing gene editing for it may have dire consequences we also accept that  our apprehension about gene editing stands stronger than our willingness to treat disorders. 

The fear of unknown takes a toll.


The question is no more how but should we , if yes then upto what extent will our morality permit. Both the parents missing RPE 65 gene responsible for visual cycle are likely to produce a child prone to blindness. Having prior knowledge and then planning for babies seem more ethical than living in cognitive dissonance. CRISPR technology makes a cut at the required site in the gene , inserts a copy of the missing gene and a illness is healed before it occurs. Genetic impairments or anomalies are permanently prevented until mutation .Genetic counselling is a strong  prophylaxis approach .


Sickle cell anemia , Cancer , HIV , Alzheimer's disease, Cystic Fibrosis, arthritis , muscle dystrophy and many more could no longer be a disease in future once CRISPR and gene editing is allowed their revolution. Gene defects patients around the globe have raised their voice demanding treatment.  Spinraza the drug cure for Werdnig-Hoffmann disease led rigorous protests which later got approved in the USA . Democratization of this technology might be some baby steps in the right direction.


Conventional methods like medication have reached their limits , it's time to pave the way for well founded means where we no more shoot in the dark , we start minding our p's and q's. Pharma monopolized medicines and drugs industry eats away one's life savings . Gene editing seems to turn around the table if regulated by fair world government institutions. 


CRISPR based gene drive system is the new hotshot. A single trait is driven into a species which eventually copies itself into the offspring and the entire new generation manifests it. This is simply an automated CRISPR where we change the future of an entire species.  


Burkina Faso witnesses death due to malaria, the mosquitoes had gone resistant to pesticides so they finally resorted to gene drive where mosquitoes were gene edited to produce only male mosquitoes.  The male population exploded shortly and the entire mosquitoes population diminished owing to the lack of female population which was no more present for procreation. Similar extinction technology is into consideration in New Zealand to control the rat's exploding population which preys on birds and have shockingly put the birds' population to extinction. 


Humanity , biodiversity or to mention even the Earth is already broken . The horror and trepidation of making things worse make us turn a deaf ear to the hue and cry that is out there in the open .  


It is a choice now , later it might be an inevitable deed to be done.
